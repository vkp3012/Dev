# Objects

<h1>Object is group of a key value pair</h1>

<br>1).Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
<br>2).Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

<h1>Opjects Property</h1>

There are two ways to access the properties of an object: 

<p>1).dot notation (.)</p>

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

2).bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.
