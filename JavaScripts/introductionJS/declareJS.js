/*.....................Declare JavaScript Variables........................*/

/*
    JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, 
    bigint, number, and object.

    For example, computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such as "12", 
    "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform mathematical operations 
    on a number, but not on a string.

    Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
    They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself.
*/

var ourName;

/*
    creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. 
    Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or 
    start with a number.

/*....................Declare String Variables....................*/

//Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

var myName;

//But you can also declare a string variable like this:

var myName = "your name";
/*
    "your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters 
    enclosed in single or double quotes.

    Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and 
    last name, respectively.
