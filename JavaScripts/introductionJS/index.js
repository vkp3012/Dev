/* 
    There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

    1).Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. 
       This is an in-line comment:

            // This is an in-line comment.

    2).You can make a multi-line comment beginning with 
       /* and ending with */
       //This is a multi-line comment:

        /* 
            This is a
            multi-line comment
        */
