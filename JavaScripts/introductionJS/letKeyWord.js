/*........................Let Keyword...........................*/
/*
    A keyword called let was introduced in ES6, a major update to JavaScript, 
    to solve this potential issue with the var keyword.
Example:- 
*/

let camper = "James";
let camper0 = "David";
/*
    The error can be seen in your browser console.

    So unlike var, when you use let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

    Update the code so it only uses the let keyword.\
Example:- 
*/
let camper1 = "James";
camper1 = "David";
