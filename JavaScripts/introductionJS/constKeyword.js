/*..............Const Keyword..................*/

/*
    In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

    const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using 
    const are read-only. 
    They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:
*/

const FAV_PET = "Cats";
FAV_PET = "Dogs";

//The console will display an error due to reassigning the value of FAV_PET.
