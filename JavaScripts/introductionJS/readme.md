# JavaScripts

    1.JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. 
    2.This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. 
    
    For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to make sure all the required fields have been filled out. The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.

# Comment Your JavaScript Code

    There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

    1).Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. 
       This is an in-line comment:

            // This is an in-line comment.

    2).You can make a multi-line comment beginning with 
       /* and ending with */
       //This is a multi-line comment:

        /* 
            This is a
            multi-line comment
        */
